## Week 1
1. [Regex Tutorial](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285)<br>
A great summary/introduction to basic regex. 
It helps me a lot with understanding what regex is and it's general purposes.

2. [Regex Cheatsheet](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/)<br>
Same as above but presented as a "cheatsheet". 
A much denser summary with even shorter explanations.
